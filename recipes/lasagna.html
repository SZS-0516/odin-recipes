			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1 pound of lean ground beef</li>
				<li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
				<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
				<li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>

				<li>Assemble your lasagna by spreading 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x12-inch baking dish. Arrange your cooked noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
